# "Game theory" simulations

Interactive platform to simulate and engage with game theory

Game theory is a key tool for analyzing strategic interactions and decision-making across diverse areas. It enhances our comprehension of human behavior in real-world situations, encompassing both cooperation and competition.

Inspired by [Robert Axelrod's 1984 The Evolution of Cooperation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316766066_Robert_Axelrod's_1984_The_Evolution_of_Cooperation) and [Veritasium's take on the topic](https://youtu.be/mScpHTIi-kM?si=15H8lTjRfC2YoQHG)
